👨‍💻 About Me

✨ Hello World! I'm a Web Developer and currently work as a Software Development Analyst. I’m always exploring new technologies and continuously improving my skills.

🚀 At the moment, I’m focusing on Java, Spring Boot, APIs REST, JavaScript, and strengthening both my back-end and front-end development skills. I also have experience with HTML, CSS, React.js, and I enjoy building clean, efficient, and well-structured applications.

📚 I’m passionate about learning — from system architecture and security to machine learning applied to sports — and I'm always working on personal and academic projects to expand my knowledge.

🌟 I use GitHub as my portfolio, where I share projects, study notes, and experiments related to my development journey.

📧 Feel free to contact me by email!

💡 You can also follow me on LinkedIn, where I share more about my work, studies, and ongoing projects.
